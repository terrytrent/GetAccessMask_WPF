# GetAccessMask_WPF

Running this will launch a Windows Form (GUI Interface).  The form will allow you to select specific security options that are available on all Windows Security Tabs.

Once selected, clicking the "Get Access Mask" button will produce another form, providing you with the Access Mask that matches the security options you specified.  This new form allows you to copy the mask to your clipboard with the "Copy To Clipboard" button.
